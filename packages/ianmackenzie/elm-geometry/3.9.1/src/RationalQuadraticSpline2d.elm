{-| A `RationalQuadraticSpline2d` is a rational quadratic BÃ©zier curve in 2D
defined by three control points and corresponding weights. This module contains
functionality for

  - Constructing splines
  - Evaluating points and tangent directions along a spline
  - Scaling, rotating, translating or mirroring a spline
  - Converting a spline between local and global coordinates in different
    reference frames

All weights should be greater than zero. If any negative weights are passed,
their absolute values will be used. Larger weights will tend to 'pull' the curve
towards the corresponding control point.

{-| Construct a [non-uniform rational B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)
(also known as a NURBS curve) from a list of knot values and a list of control
points, and return the individual segments of that B-spline as a list.

The number of knots should be one greater than the number of control points; any
extra knots or control points will be dropped. In most cases the first and last
knots will be repeated two times; for example, the knots

    [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 ]

could be used along with 6 control points to form 4 spline segments.

Note that a popular alternate convention uses two extra 'dummy' knot values at
the start and end, so if you see an example where the number of knots is _three_
greater than the number of control points (especially if you also notice that
the first and last knots are repeated three times instead of two!) then you
should drop the first and last knot values.

Knot values should be given in ascending order but will be sorted if necessary.
